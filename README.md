## 🎯 About This Repository

Welcome to **The Rec Center** – my personal recreation hub where I rebuild data structures, algorithms, and full-stack projects from scratch. This is both a **portfolio of practical knowledge** and a **learning lab**, a place where I challenge myself by recreating software fundamentals and iconic apps to better understand their inner workings.

---

## ✨ Highlights (TL;DR version)

- ✅ Recreated key **data structures** (linked lists, graphs, heaps, tries)
<!--
- 🎵 Built a **Spotify-like music player** clone with playback, search & auth
- ⚙️ Implemented classic **algorithms** (sorting, pathfinding, DP, search trees)
- 🔗 Hands-on with **low-level system design** and **API architecture**
- 📈 Tracking project progress with visual boards and clean commits

> **Quick tip for recruiters:** Browse the sections below for links to projects you're interested in. Each is designed to be self-contained.
