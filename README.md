## Overview

This repository showcases my journey in **mastering computer science fundamentals** through hands-on implementation. Rather than relying solely on libraries and frameworks, I've built core algorithms, data structures, and machine learning components from scratch to deeply understand their mechanics and trade-offs.

**What sets this repository apart:**
- **From-scratch implementations** demonstrating genuine understanding of underlying principles
- **Production-quality code** with comprehensive testing, documentation, and best practices
- **Practical applications** ranging from AI/ML to game development
- **Self-directed learning** with focus on problem-solving and software engineering excellence
